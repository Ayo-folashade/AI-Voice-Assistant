# Jezz - Voice-Activated Personal Assistant

Jezz is a simple voice-activated personal assistant built in Python. It uses speech recognition and text-to-speech technology to interact with the user and perform various tasks such as:

Playing a song on YouTube
Checking the current time
Searching for information on Wikipedia
Telling a joke
Opening a web page (e.g. Google, Gmail, news)
Taking a picture using the computer's camera
Checking the weather for a given city
Jezz uses various Python libraries such as Pyttsx3, Pywhatkit, SpeechRecognition, Wikipedia, Pyjokes, Ecapture, and Requests to implement its functionality.

To use Jezz, simply run the run_jezz() function, and speak out a command prefixed with the wake word "Jezz". Jezz will then parse the command and perform the appropriate action.

Jezz can be customized and extended to support additional commands and functionality by modifying the run_jezz() function.

Installation
To run Jezz, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer, along with the required libraries listed in requirements.txt.

To install the required libraries, run:

# pip install -r requirements.txt

You can then run Jezz by running the run_jezz() function in a Python shell or in a Python script.

Credits
This project was inspired by various voice assistants such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, and was built by Ayomide as a fun Python programming exercise.
