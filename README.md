# Jezz - Voice-Activated Personal Assistant

This is a Python code that creates a virtual assistant named "Jezz" that can perform various tasks based on voice commands. It utilizes different modules like speech_recognition, pyttsx3, pywhatkit, wikipedia, pyjokes, webbrowser, datetime, ecapture, and requests to enable the assistant to perform different actions such as playing songs on YouTube, telling the current time, searching for information on Wikipedia, opening websites like Google and Gmail, searching the web, providing news headlines, taking pictures with a camera, and fetching weather information for a specified city.

The code defines various functions that work together to enable Jezz to understand and respond to the user's voice commands. The take_command() function listens to the user's voice using the system's microphone and converts it into text using the speech_recognition module. The text is then processed by the run_jezz() function that performs different actions based on the user's command. Finally, the talk() function converts the text response to speech using the pyttsx3 module, which is played through the system's speakers.

The code also includes an infinite loop that continuously listens for user commands and executes the appropriate actions until the program is terminated. This code can be extended to add more functionality and customize the responses according to the user's preferences.
